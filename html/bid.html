Not necessary for loop courses. <span class=not_recommended>This is not recommended</span> as we won't be able to verify if a participant actually started the event. <b>Note:</b> gunstarts are already included with all start lines.</td>

          <th>Travel</th>
          <td>If possible, we will travel with you to your event. If not, then you are responsible for 50% of actual travel expenses. If there will be a checkpoint or a start line that is not at the finish line, then we need access to a vehicle on race day.</td>
